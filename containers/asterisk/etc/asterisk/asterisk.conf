; ================================
; Asterisk Main Configuration File
; ================================
; This file (usually /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf) defines where Asterisk
; stores its configuration files, modules, logs, and runtime data.
; It also sets the user, group, and some global options.

[directories]  ; Defines where Asterisk stores its files

astcachedir => /tmp
; Temporary directory used for caching.  
; Often used for generated files or temporary data.  
; Can be moved to /var/cache/asterisk on production systems.

astetcdir => /etc/asterisk
; Location of Asterisk configuration files (*.conf),  
; e.g., pjsip.conf, extensions.conf, modules.conf, etc.

astmoddir => /usr/lib/asterisk/modules
; Directory where Asterisk loads its dynamic modules (.so files).  
; Includes drivers, codecs, protocol stacks, etc.

astvarlibdir => /var/lib/asterisk
; Base directory for variable data.  
; Contains voicemails, sounds, music-on-hold, and other persistent resources.

astdbdir => /var/lib/asterisk
; Location of the internal Asterisk database (AstDB).  
; Stores key-value data such as dynamic routing info and device states.

astkeydir => /var/lib/asterisk
; Directory where encryption keys (TLS, SRTP, RSA) are stored.  
; Important when using encrypted SIP/WebRTC connections.

astdatadir => /var/lib/asterisk
; Contains sound files, system prompts, and other static resources.

astagidir => /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin
; Location for AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) scripts.  
; Used for interactive voice menus, external API calls, etc.

astspooldir => /var/spool/asterisk
; Storage for temporary files: voicemails, call recordings, faxes,  
; CDR (call detail records), and other spool data.

astrundir => /var/run/asterisk
; Runtime directory used for process-related data, including the PID file.  
; Needed for proper service management (start/stop/restart).

astlogdir => /var/log/asterisk
; Asterisk log directory.  
; Includes `full`, `messages`, `cdr-csv`, and debugging logs.  
; This is the first place to check when troubleshooting.

astsbindir => /usr/sbin
; Directory where Asterisk executables reside, such as `asterisk`  
; and `safe_asterisk`.

; ================================================================

[options]  ; Global runtime options for Asterisk

runuser = asterisk
; The Linux user under which Asterisk runs.  
; For security, **never** run Asterisk as root.

rungroup = asterisk
; The Linux group under which Asterisk runs.  
; Must match file permissions of the directories above.

documentation_language = en_US
; Default language for CLI help and documentation.

verbose = 3
; CLI verbosity level.  
; Range: 0 = minimal output, 10 = extremely detailed.  
; Recommended default: 3 (balanced).

debug = 3
; Sets the global debug level.  
; Higher values give more detailed logs but may generate a lot of output.  
; Use only when troubleshooting.

hideconnect = yes
; If set to `yes`, hides client connection details in logs and CLI.  
; Useful in production environments to reduce clutter.
